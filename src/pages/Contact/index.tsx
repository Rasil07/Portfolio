        I'm seeking out opportunities to collaborate with companies / agencies /
        individuals, not just work for them. I want to bring my collective
        design experience to the table where we can work together to solve real
        business-problems in a way that optimizes all of our respective
        experience and knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want to avoid subjective pissing-matches, and favor open-minded
        collaborators where egos are out of the equation. If that all sounds
        about right, then lets for sure chat about how we can work together.
      </p>
      <p>Feel free to reach out through any platforms bellow:</p>
